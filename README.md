## Question
$X$ be a compact metric space with atleast two points and $a\in X$. Then either $X\smallsetminus\{a\}$ is compact or $X$ is connected, but not both.
Let us assume that $X$ is connected and if possible $X\smallsetminus\{a\}$ is compact. Then $X\smallsetminus\{a\}$ is closed. Also $\{a\}$ is a closed subset of $X$. This contradicts that $X=(X\smallsetminus\{a\})\cup\{a\}$ is connected. 
Conversely if $A=X\smallsetminus\{a\}$ is compact then it will be closed in $X$ and we will have $X=A\cup B$, for $B=\{a\}$. Thus $X$ is not connected.
